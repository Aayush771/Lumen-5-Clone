# <span style="color:red">Our Journey: </span>
As we are all new and never work on a project so our first day gone in discussion about how we start and who did which work, In evening finally we decide distribute our work.
On the second day we start with our morning scrum and decide the deadline to complete the whole project and start working on it, the In evening stand-up we discussed our challenges and problem and try to resolve them.
2 days we have the same routine and finally on the fourth day our given task is ready but when we merge the all parts the main problem came like many classes and ids are same due to that the structure of all products was very bad but our Team take it as a challenge and change and put comments on code in just one and half day.
on the seventh day again we merge all our code and finally, we did it, There were some changes that need to be done and we all did it and finally, we record our presentation and Submit.
